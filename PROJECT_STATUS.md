## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only (no database required)
make test
./test.sh

# All tests with PostgreSQL container
./test-with-db.sh
make test-db

# Tests with coverage analysis  
./test-with-db.sh -c
make test-coverage

# Specific test categories
./test-with-db.sh ./pkg/persistence/postgres  # Database tests
./test-with-db.sh ./pkg/integration           # Integration tests
make test-db-only                              # Database tests only
```

### Container Management

```bash
# Manual container lifecycle
make docker-up                    # Start PostgreSQL container
go test ./pkg/persistence/postgres -v
make docker-down                  # Stop and cleanup

# Using test script
./test-with-db.sh --start-only    # Start container only
./test-with-db.sh -k              # Keep container after tests
./test-with-db.sh -s              # Stop container
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build and test
make build                        # Build server binary
make check                        # Format, vet, and test
make clean                        # Clean artifacts

# Coverage analysis
make coverage-html                # Generate and open coverage report
```
