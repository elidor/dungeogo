- ✅ Automatic container lifecycle management
- ✅ Isolated test databases per run
- ✅ Proper cleanup and resource management

**🔄 Fallback Strategy**
- ✅ Tries containerized PostgreSQL (port 5433)
- ✅ Falls back to local PostgreSQL (port 5432)  
- ✅ Gracefully skips DB tests if unavailable
- ✅ No test failures due to missing dependencies

**📊 Test Infrastructure Tools**
- ✅ `test-with-db.sh`: Full container management script
- ✅ `Makefile`: Development task automation
- ✅ Coverage reporting with HTML output
- ✅ Concurrent test execution support
